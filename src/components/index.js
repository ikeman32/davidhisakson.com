//Import your custom components here
import Home from './home/Home';

//Then export them here
export {Home};

/*
What this does is allow you to import a list of components like so
import {Home, comp1, comp2} from './components';

Instead of 
import Home from './components/home/Home';
import comp1 from './components/comp1/comp1;
etc
